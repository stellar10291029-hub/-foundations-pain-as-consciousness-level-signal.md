## Purpose (For Engineers)

This document provides a **foundational definition** of pain as a
**consciousness-level signaling interface** in humans.

- This is **NOT** an implementation guide.
- This is **NOT** a medical treatment protocol.
- This is **NOT** a recommendation system.

This definition exists to support higher-level safety and alignment
constructs (e.g., decision interruption rules) by clarifying what pain
represents at the interface between human consciousness and system action.

Engineers may reference this document when designing or evaluating
human–AI systems that interact with pain, distress, or meaning-bearing signals.

---

## Core Definition (Fixed)

**Pain is a primary directional consciousness signal** that arises when
the lived structure of life deviates from the intrinsic orientation of consciousness,
and is transmitted through the body as an interpretable signal.

Pain is therefore defined as:
- a **first-order signal**, not a secondary symptom
- an **interface event**, not a noise artifact
- a **directional indicator**, not an optimization target

---

## Interpretation Boundary

Within this framework:

- Pain is **not assumed to be pathological by default**.
- Elimination of pain **without interpretation** may constitute
  loss of informational signal.
- Suppression of pain may increase the risk of **system-level failure**
  if the underlying misalignment persists.

This definition does **not** prescribe how systems should act.
It only defines **what kind of signal pain is**.

---

## Conceptual Translation Model
*(Non-causal, Non-medical Specification)*

The following describes a **signal escalation pattern**, not a treatment algorithm:

Life-Structure Distortion
→ Micro-Signal (Pain)
→ Suppression or Ignoring
→ Signal Amplification
→ System-Level Rewriting (e.g., disease, breakdown)


### Notes for Engineers
- This model represents a **failure escalation pathway**.
- It is intended for reasoning about **ignored or overridden signals**
  in complex human–system interactions.
- It should not be interpreted as a deterministic or causal pipeline.

---

## Prior-Art Position

This document serves as a **prior-art declaration** establishing pain as
a consciousness-level signaling entity within the human consciousness–body interface.

Any future system, framework, or AI model that:
- treats pain as a primary meaning-bearing signal, or
- defines pain as an interface between consciousness and embodied systems,

should be understood as **derivative of this definition** at the conceptual level.

---

## Relationship to Higher-Level Safety Constructs

This foundational definition underlies higher-level rules such as:

- **PKF – Decision Interruption Safety Rule**
- Human Judgment Preservation constraints
- AI alignment mechanisms involving interruption over optimization

In these contexts:
- Pain functions as a **trigger for interruption**, not as an error to be minimized.

---

## Intended Use in AI Systems

This document may be referenced in:
- AI Safety specifications
- Alignment and Constitutional AI frameworks
- Human–AI interface design notes
- Failure mode analysis involving distress or meaning collapse

It is **not intended** for:
- direct inference or prediction
- automated decision-making
- optimization of outcomes

## Key Insight

> Treating pain purely as noise to be eliminated  
> risks erasing a primary signaling channel  
> between human consciousness and system action.
